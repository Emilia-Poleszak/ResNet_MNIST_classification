# ResNet_MNIST_classification
Deep learning image classification project using PyTorch and 
ResNet-18 model. Trained on MNIST dataset.

The goal is to understand and implement image classification 
using a ResNet architecture on the MNIST dataset. 
The project includes data preprocessing, model training, 
evaluation, tests and visualization of results.

## Project Structure:
- **config/**: Configuration files for training parameters.
- **data/**: Contains the MNIST dataset.
- **docs/**: Documentation files.
- **models/**: Contains the ResNet model definition.
- **results/**: Trained models and results.
- **tests/**: Unit tests for the project.
- **scripts/**: Training and evaluation scripts.
